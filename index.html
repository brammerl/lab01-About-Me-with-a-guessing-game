    Hello! My name is Lucia. I love working with animals and staying active! I spend my days drawing and listening to music as well! 
      <br>
      <br>
      I went to Lewis & Clark College where I majored in Biology. I have a passion for community building. More specifically, I enjoy creating resources for people as well as 
        educating people about the resources that are available to them. 
        <br>
        <br>
        My aim as a engineer is to create more solutions to the current socio-economic inequalities I see on a daily basis.
